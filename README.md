Version 2.6

Dege's Demeo Setup & Users Guide featuring The "House Rules" Customization Mod.

The current version of the guide is 2.6. A few folks recently referred to this guide as a bible or a wiki. 
I am flattered. Starting to get user feedback now ands that is fantastic. Its telling me that the content
is getting read and hopefully absorbed in some capacity. This started out as a mod guide and has certainly
transformed. 

This version has expanded beyond 115 pages now, wow! 

Here are some new areas of interest.

NEW
- Reader Feedback from "Frak". See troubleshooting section and watch new YouTube video on how to troubleshoot
  your custom .json files with this cool utility!

- Dege's YouTube Channel has over a half a dozen narrated walk-throughs. It will help you decide floors to use
  when customizing your game. 

- I have decided to offer you a chance to be in future video tapings as I perform
  a walkthrough. Want to be a volunteer guest in a future taping? Send your request to Demeo@epomd.com. We will
  meet in a private multi-player room and it will take no more than 15-20 minutes.

- Added Baddies section with some closeups of some classic characters. What is your favorite that you would like
  to see?

- Refreshed Black Sarcophagus maps with additional floor views.
