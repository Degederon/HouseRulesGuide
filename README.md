Dege's Demeo Setup \& Users Guide featuring The "House Rules" Customization Mod.



This guide has been available since 2023 and it is now time for an update in 2025. Utilizing AI and have a lot of ideas to share, so stay tuned and keep a current copy of the guide for reference.



This version has expanded beyond 130 pages and growing.



Here are some new areas of interest.



* Section 25 is really coming along and introduces a series of custom and fully commented rulesets. Even tried my hand at creating a Guardian and Bard only ruleset. It plays four full and balanced levels of gameplay. Introducing AI in the mix to check for a balanced gameplay. Check it out and send your comments to Demeo@epomd.com. More are coming!
* YouTube play throughs are being planned. If you would like me to join you, send an invite to Demeo@epomd.com and we will record for entertainment value and get it on YouTube!
* All maps are in this version with beautiful screen captures.
* New Rulesets created, tested and available for you to download and try out.



Coming soon are expanded troubleshooting and brand new scenarios I will be releasing on GitHub!



Thanks,



Dege
