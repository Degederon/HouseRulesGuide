Dege's Demeo Setup & Users Guide featuring The "House Rules" Customization Mod.

The current version of the guide is 2.8. A few folks recently referred to this guide as a bible or a wiki. I am flattered. Starting to get user feedback now ands that is fantastic. Its telling me that the content is getting read and hopefully absorbed in some capacity. This started out as a mod guide and has certainly transformed.

Announcement - Would like to play some beta maps and need 3 additional players. If you are interested send me an email to demeo@epomd.com. If you like to raise hell and have fun in the process, let me know. What nights are good for you and what timezone.
This version has expanded beyond 125 pages now, wow!

Here are some new areas of interest.

NEW

Updated Steam Achievement section with more details.

Improved on Cool Links section.

If you have suggestions, screen captures, troubleshooting, real life issue and solutions or other topic inclusions, send them to demeo@epomd.com.

Happy Gaming,

Dege
