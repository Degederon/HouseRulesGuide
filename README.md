Version 2.4
Dege's Demeo Setup & Users Guide featuring The "House Rules" Customization Mod.

The current version of the guide is 2.4. Well it has only been a few days and now another
chock full of nuts version to release.

This version contains even more than the last version as we crest over 100 pages now.
Here are some areas of interest.

- New Steam achievment section has been added
- New section for Demeo chapters now include Black Sarcophagus, Rat King and Roots of Evil. Videos will be going up
  but waiting for Youtube to expand my rights and privs to post beyond ten items a day. Should be all set with them
  by June 25th. 
- Youtube video links have been added to Black Sarcophagus to show you around each level.
- More Youtube links will be added soon when further rights are granted.
- Shop levels have randomized audio tracks and a short track and link have been put together for you to download from Github.
- New Cool Links section - This has lots of links to check out from Demeo artists and their artwork. So much to download so check it out. 
- Added Character Section has been added
- Added more detail for certain mod features with illustrations and explanation.
- Minor formatting issues and added troubleshooting items

If you have suggestions, screen captures, troubleshooting, real life issue and solutions or other topic inclusions, send them to demeo@epomd.com.
