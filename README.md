Dege's Demeo Setup \& Users Guide featuring The "House Rules" Customization Mod.



This guide has been available since 2023 and it is now time for an update in 2025. Utilizing AI and have a lot of ideas to share, so stay tuned and keep a current copy of the guide for reference.



This version has expanded beyond 130 pages and growing.



Here are some new areas of interest.



* New Card section - Tested as many cards as possible and revealed my results.
* I implemented a Ready to Go(RTG) installation process that will virtually eliminate all of the downloads required. Take a look!
* The rules and configuration section is getting overhauled and expanded. The authors documentation is very good and the examples you will see will expand how the rule is to be used and behaves in real life!
* YouTube play throughs are being planned. If you would like me to join you, send an invite to Demeo@epomd.com and we will record for entertainment value and get it on YouTube!
* All maps are in this version with beautiful screen captures.


Coming soon are expanded troubleshooting and brand new scenarios I will be releasing on GitHub!



Thanks,



Dege
