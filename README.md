# HouseRulesGuide
060423 Created by Degederon for Demeo gamers.
Version 2.1
Dege's Demeo Setup & Users Guide featuring The "House Rules" Customization Mod.

The current version of the guide is 2.1. A lot of work going into breaking out
sections and examples for further understanding. Until I can get a more dynamic
way to view, please download the pdf and view.

This version contains a lot of information. Here are some areas of interest.

- Added Character Section
- Added more detail for certain mod features with illustrations and explanation.
- Minor formatting issues and new Table of Contents

If you have suggestions, screen captures, troubleshooting, real life issue and solutions or other topic inclusions, send them to demeo@epomd.com.

Happy Gaming,

Dege
