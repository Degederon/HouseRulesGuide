Version 2.3
Dege's Demeo Setup & Users Guide featuring The "House Rules" Customization Mod.

The current version of the guide is 2.3. A lot of work going into breaking out
sections and examples for further understanding. Until I can get a more dynamic
way to view, please download the pdf and view.

This version contains a lot of information. Here are some areas of interest.

- Start new Troubleshooting section.
- Add section for Demeo maps and illustrate each level for each map
- Starting with Black SARCOPHAGUS. YUoutube video links to show you around each level.
- Next week will add next map series.
- Added Character Section
- Added more detail for certain mod features with illustrations and explanation.
- Minor formatting issues and new Table of Contents

If you have suggestions, screen captures, troubleshooting, real life issue and solutions or other topic inclusions, send them to demeo@epomd.com.

Happy Gaming,
