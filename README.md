Thank you for your emails! This guide is slowly being referenced as a bible or wiki for Demeo. I am flattered. 
The feedback is letting me know that it is helping you to install the game or even take a stab at making
your own json file. This started out as a mod guide for "House Rules" and I figured why stop there.
